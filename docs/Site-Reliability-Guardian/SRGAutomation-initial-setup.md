# Site Reliability Guardian (SRG) - initial setup

To configure the initial Site Reliability Guardian for a CI/CD usage follow the steps:

Pre-requisites:

- One agent already monitoring at least one host.

## 1. Install the Site Reliability Guardian

Search in the Dynatrace Hub for the Site Reliability Guardian and install it in your Dynatrace Environment.

## 2. Create a new Guardian

Locate the Site Reliability Guardian app in the sidebar and click `+ guardian` button.

You need to identify a host/process that you want to monitor and then create a basic SLO expression. Later, you can enhance or replace this definition with a more complex SLO.
If you want to get started quickly, you can use an expression like this one in the DQL input box:

```
timeseries avg(dt.host.cpu.usage), alias:cpu,  filter:{host.name == "your-host-name-here"} | fields cpu_single = arrayMax(cpu)
```

This expression fetches the max cpu usage for the timeframe of the evaluation (from 0 to 100%).

You can then add some thresholds to control the CPU usage during the test like in the image. You can later fine tune those values depending on the real values of your server/app.

<summary>(Optional) Add SLO service metrics from Dynatrace SLO UI</summary>
If you want to consume service metrics like `response time` or `error rate` of a service you need to create a SLO in the previous Dynatrace UI:

1.  Go to Cloud Automation > Service-level objectives and create a new SLO

    <img src="./assets/srg-create-service-slo-1.png"  width="550" height="600">

    Under the metric expression you can use this example:

    ```
    ((builtin:service.response.time:avg:partition("latency",value("good",lt(400000))):splitBy():count:default(0))/(builtin:service.response.time:avg:splitBy():count)*(100))
    ```

    > This expression measures service performance by counting the number of request during which the response latency is below the defined threshold 400000 [Âµs] or 400 ms. (you need to have traffic against your service for this expression to work)

    For the entity filters, you can use a combination of entity type and tags to find the target entity in Dynatrace. i.e.:

    ```
    type("SERVICE"),tag("[Environment]DT_RELEASE_PRODUCT:simplenodeservice","environment:canary")
    ```

    > Note: Replace this tags `"[Environment]DT_RELEASE_PRODUCT:simplenodeservice","environment:canary"` with your service tags.

2.  Add the SLO in the Site Reliability guardian created in the previous step.
    Select the SLO definition created in Dynatrace during the previous step as part of the guardian configuration.

    Finally, set the thresholds for the Site Reliability Guardian as the following image.

    ## <img src="./assets/srg-thresholds.png"  width="900" height="345">

    > Note: The return value of the SLO is a percentage from 0 to 100% where, 100% means that all the request in the specified timeframe are lower than the maximum value of 400ms. The thresholds set for this SLO are:
    >
    > - 99% for a warning (for every 100 requests 1 request slower than 400ms)
    > - 95% for a failure (for every 100 requests 5 requests are slower than 400ms)

    </details>

## 3. Create a Dynatrace Workflow

Create a **Dynatrace Workflow** that includes the Site Reliability Guardian application. You can navigate into the Site Reliability Guardian and click in the option `create workflow`. This will open a new tab with the new workflow created.

<img src="./assets/workflow-shortcut.png"  width="675" height="400">

Then modify the Event trigger to follow this expression:

```
type == "guardian.validation.triggered" AND tag.service == "your-service-name" AND tag.stage == "you-stage-name"
```

> Note: The values for `tag.service` and `tag.stage` will be used as parameters during the CLI execution.

<img src="./assets/workflow-filter.png"  width="675" height="400">

The start time and end time expression _is already added to the SRG task_ like in the image:
`{{event()['timeframe.from']}}` and end time `{{event()['timeframe.to']}}`

You are ready to execute a Site Reliability Guardian evaluation.
